// Time Complexity: O(n)
// Space Complexity: O(k)

/*
    Every time before entering a new element, we first need to check whether the element present at the front is out of bounds of our present window size.
    If so, we need to pop that out. Also, we need to check from the rear that the element present is smaller than the incoming element.
    If yes, thereâ€™s no point storing them and hence we pop them out. Finally, the element present at the front would be our largest element.
